# Indent and De-indent lines in Vim.

This is very useful while dealing with Python code, or better yet, editing YAML config files for Kubernetes.

Place cursor at the start of line, press `Ctrl+v` to visually select and then press `j` to cover as many lines as you want to indent/de-indent.

Then use `>` for indent and `<` for de-indent.

In insert mode, you can use `Ctrl+t` to indent and `Ctrl+d` to de-indent.
