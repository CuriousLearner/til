# TIL: Finding Git Commits That Touched a Specific File or String

When working with **Git**, you may need to track changes to a file or find when a specific option (e.g., `-j` in a `Makefile`) was introduced or modified. Here are some useful commands:

| **Use Case**                                      | **Command**                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Show full commit history for a file               | `git log --follow -- Makefile`                        |
| Show commit history with diffs                    | `git log --follow -p -- Makefile`                     |
| Show only commits that added/removed `-j`         | `git log --follow -S'-j' -- Makefile`                 |
| Show full details of commits affecting `-j`       | `git log --follow -S'-j' -p -- Makefile`              |
| Find first commit that introduced `-j`            | `git log --follow --diff-filter=A -S'-j' -- Makefile` |
| Show only the added/removed lines containing `-j` | `git log --follow -p -- Makefile                      | grep --color -E '^-.\*-j | ^\+.\*-j'` |

ðŸ”¹ **Key Flags Explained**:

- `--follow` â†’ Continues tracking history even if the file was renamed.
- `-p` â†’ Shows diffs (code changes).
- `-S'<string>'` â†’ Finds commits where `<string>` was added or removed.
- `--diff-filter=A` â†’ Finds the commit where the file or string first appeared.

ðŸš€ Now you can efficiently track changes in Git!
