# git rev-parse for parsing Git revision information

`git rev-parse` is a command used in Git, a distributed version control system. This command is used to parse Git revision information. It can be used to get the SHA-1 hash of a commit, the name of a branch, or the path of a file in the repository.

Here are some examples of how to use `git rev-parse`:

1. Get the SHA-1 hash of the current commit:

   ```bash
   git rev-parse HEAD
   ```

    This will output the SHA-1 hash of the current commit.

2. Get the name of the current branch:

    ```bash
    git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
    ```

    This will output the name of the current branch.
