# Target in Docker Compose File

By associating specific stages with targets, you can build only the necessary components, reducing build times and optimizing resource usage.

If you have a Dockerfile, you can specify a target to build specific stages, like this:

```docker
# Stage 1: Build stage
FROM python:3.7-slim as builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Stage 2: Runtime stage
FROM python:3.7-slim as runtime

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages
COPY --from=builder /app /app

CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver"]
```

This Dockerfile separates the build process (`builder` stage) from the runtime environment (`runtime` stage), optimizing the final image size and dependencies.

To build and deploy only the runtime environment, define a target in your Docker Compose file:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      target: runtime
```

You can then build your image with a specific target using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose build web
```

Or directly with docker build:

```bash
docker build -t my_image . --target runtime
```

This approach ensures you build only the necessary stages, improving efficiency.
